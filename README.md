# SHAPEAI PYTHON AND MACHINE LEARNING BOOTCAMP
Hi I made this project during the 7 Days Free Bootcamp, conducted by SHAPEAI . The instructor during the session was Mr. Shaurya Sinha (Data Analyst Intern at Jio). I got to learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI.

Here's the link for you to watch the sessions  as well![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103595490/193255136-23fe144d-a4c7-494a-8d1a-464e681318d9.png)


I got to have hands on experience on:

* Python <br/>
* Machine Learning <br/>
* Tensorflow <br/>
during these 7 days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that anyone with zero experience on programming can learn. I enjoyed these 7 days, you can as well. To register for next free 7 days bootcamp, visit: www.shapeai.tech or follow SHAPEAI on:<br/>
